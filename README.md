Malware Detection

The proliferation of malware poses a serious threat to user
security and privacy. The primary objective of this research is to
develop and evaluate machine learning models to accurately
detect malware. The objective is to assess the performance of
various classification algorithms against a single user-specific
dataset to determine which models are most suitable for use in
real-world scenarios. The project commences with the collection
of data and preprocessing of malicious and non-malicious
applications. The data is then carefully chosen to train and test the
models using modern features extraction and preprocessing
techniques. Various classification techniques are employed,
including Decision Trees (DMTs), Support Vector Machines with
various kernels (SVM), Logistics Regression (LGRs), KNNs (KNNs),
and Sequential Neural Networks (SNNs). The performance of each
model is measured in terms of precision, recall and F1 score
through meticulous experimentation and review of the results.
The results provide valuable insights into the pros and cons of each
method when it comes to Android virus detection, with the SNN
being the most accurate.
